Compilation for lucille
=======================

1. Building lsh( lucille shell, renderer itself )
2. Building lsh with MPI( for parallel rendering)
3. external library lsh used.


1. Building lsh( lucille shell, renderer itself )

  cygwin and linux(or other UNIX like system):
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install (optional)
	$ ./src/lsh/lsh RIBFILE

	compile options:

		$ ./configure --disable-debug

		turn on optimization.

		$ ./configure --disable-debug --enable-sse

		turn on optimization with SSE.
		(You will need PentiumIII or higher CPU)

  OS-X:
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install (optional)
	$ ./src/lsh/lsh RIBFILE

	compile options:

		$ ./configure --disable-debug

		turn on optimization.

		$ ./configure --enable-altivec

		use AltiVec.
		(You shold need PowerPC G4 or higher)

		$ ./configure --enable-profile

		enable profiling for gprof.


2. Building lsh with MPI( for parallel rendering )

  If you want parallel rendering with lucille, first install MPI library
  into your machines.

  MPI is widely used message passing library interface for parallel computing.
  There are two major free implementation of MPI specification.

	- mpich
	  http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/

	- LAM/MPI
	  http://www.lam-mpi.org/
  
  Then, build lsh with

	$ ./configure --with-mpi
	$ make

  You can specify optimization options with --with-mpi. e.g,
	$ ./configure --disable-debug --with-mpi
	$ ./configure --disable-debug --enable-sse --with-mpi (x86 only)
	$ ./configure --disable-debug --enable-altivec --with-mpi (G4 only)


  To execute MPI version of lsh, you should use mpirun command.

	$ mpirun -np N lsh RIBFILE

  Where N is number of Processing Elements to run. lsh and RIB file should
  be installed all machines if file system does not uses NFS.  


3. lsh uses following library as optional( for UNIX like system ).
   It is recommanded to install this libraries, but it may possible to
   build lsh without such libraries.

   libtiff:
	to save a TIFF format image(highly recommanded).

   libjpeg:
	to convert a JPEG format image to the texture file.

   readline:
	to provide bash like command line shell.

   X Window:
	for "framebuffer" display driver.

   dmalloc:
	for memory debugging(e.g. memory leaks).
