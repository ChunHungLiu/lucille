How to support shadeop in RSL compiler 
=======================================

Procedure
---------

 * Compile RSL code
 * If unresolved function was found, seek the symbol from shadeop DLLs in the search path.

How to search symbols in dll
----------------------------

 * dlopen(filename.so)
 * Seek global data symbol ``filename_optables`` in the DLL.
   * If the global symbol was not found, its not a shadeop DLL.
 * Parse string in the shadeop field in ``filename_optables``
 * Find init, main, cleanup function whose name is given by ``filename_optables`` from the DLL.


Future plan
-----------

Use LLVM! LLVM enables IPO over DSO boundary.
