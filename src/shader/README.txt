Shader
======

This directory contains codes for lucille shader engine(LSE)

LSE
---

LSE is LLVM powered JIT execution of programmable shader language. The shader runs as fast as native code.


TODO
----

Run shader code in secure so that the renderer no longer segfault by buggy shader code. Investigate the technology such like SVM(Secure Virtual Machine) or NaCl(Native Client)
